### Async-first design

Every slow operation — LLM plant analysis, illustrated image generation, reminder recomputation — runs in a background job. The HTTP request thread returns immediately with a `202 Accepted` and a job status. The frontend polls (every 3 seconds) while jobs are in progress and shows clear PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED state.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Java 21
- Node.js 18+
- Maven

### 1. Start PostgreSQL

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This maps Postgres to host port **5434** (container listens on 5432) with:
- database: `planted_db`
- user: `planted`
- password: `planted`

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

The backend starts on `http://localhost:8080` (all interfaces — reachable on your LAN IP for API-only clients).  
Flyway runs migrations from `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/` on startup.  
Images are stored locally in `./backend/data/images/`.

### 3. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## LAN development (phones / other machines on Wi‑Fi)

Use this when you open the UI from another device on the same private network (no router WAN port forwarding — that would expose the app to the internet).

1. Start Postgres, Spring (`local` profile), and the frontend with **`npm run dev:lan`** in `frontend/` (listens on `0.0.0.0:3000`).
2. In **development**, the browser talks only to **Next on port 3000**. Next.js **rewrites** `/api/*` and `/images/*` to Spring at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, so API calls and local plant images work from a phone without `localhost` on the wrong device.
3. Spring returns **root-relative** image paths (`/images/...`) when `planted.storage.public-base-url` is unset; set that property only if something calls Spring **directly** for images (no Next proxy).
4. **CORS** for direct browser→Spring calls is configured via `planted.cors.allowed-origin-patterns` in `application.yml` (localhost, Vercel, private LAN patterns). Same-origin traffic through Next does not need CORS for `/api`.
5. Next.js 16 **allowedDevOrigins** is populated from this machine’s private IPv4 addresses at dev startup; use **`PLANTED_DEV_EXTRA_ORIGINS`** (comma-separated) if you need more hosts.

Details and env hints: **[frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)**. Quick helper (prints LAN IP and start lines): **`./scripts/planted-lan-dev.sh`**.

---

## Ship (commit + push)

**Ship** means documentation and Cursor context are updated when they apply to the change — not only git. Before pushing:

- Follow **[scripts/ship-checklist.md](scripts/ship-checklist.md)**.
- Observe **[.cursor/rules/ship.mdc](.cursor/rules/ship.mdc)**.

If you intend **code only** with no doc/context pass, say so explicitly (e.g. “ship code only”).

## UI Layout

### Plant Detail Page (Bio Page)
The plant detail page is a fixed-height, no-scroll landscape layout designed for web app use. It fills the full viewport (`100dvh`) with two columns:

- **Left column (34%):** Hero photo (fills available height) → Reference + Photo history thumbnails only.
- **Right column (flex-1):** Name/species/location header → PlantStatusCard → compact **growing** line (indoor/outdoor, optional snippet from placement notes when indoor, coords hints, optional `weatherCareNote`) → species + Care panels side-by-side (both scroll internally, bottoms align with thumbnail row). The **History** block in About can show **per-day LLM digests** (`historyDailyDigests` from the latest completed summary job) when present; otherwise it falls back to mingling structured `historyEntries` with legacy parsed summary text. **Refresh summary** re-runs the async history job (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`). The **Care** panel ends with a compact **observation** box (text note, optional photo with caption). Text-only notes go to `addHistoryNote`; submitting a **photo** calls `uploadPlantPhoto` → **`POST /api/plants/{id}/photos`**, which promotes it to the hero/main image, pushes the previous photo into the left-column Photo history strip, auto-records a history entry ("Added a new photo[: caption]"), and refreshes the `HEALTH_ASSESSMENT` bio section against the new photo. Propagation tips are not shown in About.

The back link (`← All plants`) is absolutely positioned so it doesn't consume layout space.

### Plant List Page
Each list card thumbnail uses: `illustratedImage` → `originalImage` (user's own upload) → Sprout placeholder. Internet-sourced reference images (`HEALTHY_REFERENCE`) are never used as list thumbnails — the list shows only the user's personal photos.

The **`ReminderIconRow`** underneath each card (and on the `/screensaver` tiles) always renders six fixed icons — **water, fertilizer, pruning, light, placement, health** — and illuminates the ones that need attention. Water/fertilizer/pruning are driven by scheduled care events (`wateringDue|wateringOverdue`, `fertilizerDue`, `pruningDue`); **light, placement, and health** are driven by LLM-authored booleans on each bio section: `LIGHT_CARE.attentionNeeded`, `PLACEMENT_CARE.attentionNeeded`, and `HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.attentionNeeded`, with accompanying short `attentionReason` strings used as tooltip/aria copy. `PlantReminderService.syncBioAttention` denormalises those three flags + reasons onto `plant_reminder_state` so the list stays a single fast read.

**Your Location:** Optional home or growing-site address (`GET` / `PUT /api/user/location`, JSON `{ "address": "..." | null }`). Stored in `user_physical_addresses` keyed by `planted.user.default-id` until real auth exists; new plants get the same `user_id` on registration. When set, registration, reanalysis, pruning, and history-summary prompts include it as regional climate context only (no live weather APIs).

## Environment Variables

### Backend (application-local.yml defaults, override via env)

| Variable | Description | Local default |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (required for analysis) | — |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` | PostgreSQL JDBC URL | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5434/planted_db` (matches `docker-compose` host port) |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` | DB username | `planted` |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | DB password | `planted` |
| `PLANTED_HISTORY_DAY_BOUNDARY_ZONE` | IANA timezone id for **calendar-day bucketing** in history-summary jobs when the plant has **no** latitude/longitude (or geolocation lookup yields no zone). Example: `America/Chicago`. | `UTC` (see `planted.history` in `application.yml`) |
| `PLANTED_USER_DEFAULT_ID` | Logical user id for `plants.user_id` and `user_physical_addresses` until auth is wired | `default` (see `planted.user.default-id` in `application.yml`) |

History summary jobs (`POST /api/plants/{id}/history/summary`) load prompt text from **`llm_prompts`** (Flyway migrations). After changing migrations, restart the backend so Flyway applies them. When the plant has coordinates, day boundaries use an embedded **lat/lon → timezone** lookup instead of this fallback.

### Backend (prod profile, via env)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL JDBC URL |
| `DB_USERNAME` | DB username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | DB password |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |
| `S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket name |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region (default: `us-east-1`) |
| `SQS_QUEUE_URL` | SQS queue URL for background jobs |

### Frontend

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Backend base URL for browser `fetch` | In **development**, leave unset so requests use same-origin `/api` (Next rewrites to Spring). Set for production builds or when the UI must call a fixed API host. |
| `PLANTED_API_PROXY_ORIGIN` | (Next dev only) Where to proxy `/api` and `/images` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `PLANTED_DEV_EXTRA_ORIGINS` | (Next dev only) Extra entries for `allowedDevOrigins` | — |

## Reminder Strategy

Reminder state is **precomputed and persisted** in the `plant_reminder_state` table. The plant list page reads directly from this table — no live LLM calls.

Reminder state is recomputed (via `PLANT_REMINDER_RECOMPUTE` job) whenever:
- A watering event is recorded
- A fertilizer event is recorded
- A prune event is recorded
- Registration or reanalysis completes
- Growing context or coordinates are updated (`PATCH /api/plants/{id}/growing`)
- Placement seed text is updated (`PATCH /api/plants/{id}/placement`), which enqueues reanalysis and then follows the same completion path as registration
- The **outdoor refresh** scheduler enqueues recompute for active **outdoor** plants that have **latitude and longitude** (default: every 8 hours; see `planted.outdoor-reminder-refresh` in `application.yml`)

The recompute logic in `PlantReminderService`:
1. Reads the latest completed `PlantAnalysis` for watering/fertilizer/pruning frequency
2. Reads the most recent care event from each history table
3. Computes days elapsed vs frequency → sets `wateringDue`, `fertilizerDue`, `pruningDue`
4. For **outdoor** plants with coordinates, fetches a compact **Open-Meteo** snapshot (worker only — never on the HTTP thread), adjusts instruction copy, sets optional `weather_care_note`, and may conservatively clear `wateringDue` when heavy recent rain applies **and** the plant is not already overdue. If weather is disabled or the API fails, logic falls back to the non-weather instructions.
5. Generates plain-language next-step instructions (pruning line prefers `pruning_action_summary`, then legacy `pruning_guidance`, then `pruning_general_guidance`)
6. Calls `syncBioAttention` to copy `attentionNeeded` / `attentionReason` from the `LIGHT_CARE`, `PLACEMENT_CARE`, and `HEALTH_ASSESSMENT` bio sections onto `plant_reminder_state.{light,placement,health}_attention_needed` + `*_attention_reason` (same sync is also run at the tail of `PlantBioSectionProcessor` after each of those sections completes)
7. Upserts `PlantReminderState`

**Privacy / coordinates:** Outdoor weather needs approximate **lat/lon** stored on the plant. They are used only for public weather data (default provider: Open-Meteo, no key). Users can enter rounded coordinates if they want less precision.

**Configuration:** `planted.weather.*` (enable flag, Open-Meteo URL, cache TTL, rain/heat thresholds, `past-days` / `forecast-days`) and `planted.outdoor-reminder-refresh.enabled` / `cron`. Integration tests disable both by default via `application-test.yml`.

Registration and reanalysis persist **paired care text** for the UI: short primary lines plus separate general guidance for light (`light_needs` / `light_general_guidance`), placement (`placement_guidance` / `placement_general_guidance`), and pruning (`pruning_action_summary` / `pruning_general_guidance`). The API exposes these on `latestAnalysis` (`AnalysisSummaryDto`). Existing analyses only gain the new gray lines after a new registration or reanalysis.

## Local Storage vs S3

Controlled by Spring profiles:

| Profile | Image storage | Queue |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | `LocalImageStorageService` → `./data/images/` | `LocalPlantJobPublisher` (Spring events, async) |
| `prod` | `S3ImageStorageService` → AWS S3 | `SqsPlantJobPublisher` → Amazon SQS |

Both implement `ImageStorageService` and `PlantJobPublisher` interfaces — no application logic changes between profiles.

Local files are served by Spring at `/images/**` (resource handler). With the **Next dev proxy**, clients typically load `http://<next-host>:3000/images/...`, which forwards to Spring. For API consumers that bypass Next, optionally set `planted.storage.public-base-url` so JSON includes absolute URLs.

---

## SQS Configuration

In production, `SqsPlantJobPublisher` sends JSON `PlantJobMessage` objects to an SQS standard queue. Message format:

```json
{
  "jobType": "PLANT_REGISTRATION_ANALYSIS",
  "plantId": 123,
  "analysisId": 456,
  "imageIds": [789]
}
```

To set up SQS:
1. Create a standard queue in your AWS account (474120878015)
2. Set `SQS_QUEUE_URL` to the queue URL
3. Attach an IAM role/policy with `sqs:SendMessage` and `sqs:ReceiveMessage`

For local dev, the `LocalPlantJobPublisher` publishes Spring `ApplicationEvent`s, which `PlantJobWorker` handles asynchronously on a dedicated thread pool (`plantJobExecutor`). No SQS setup required.

---

## Prompt Storage

Prompts are versioned in the `llm_prompts` table (seeded by `V6__create_llm_prompts.sql`). Every OpenAI call is audited in `llm_requests` with the rendered prompt and response — enabling full debuggability and future prompt iteration without losing history.

Prompt keys:
- `plant_registration_analysis_v1` — **legacy** monolithic species ID + care guidance. Still populated during the transition so `latestAnalysis` remains a fallback for older plants. New plant content should be added as a bio-section prompt (below), not here.
- **Decomposed bio sections** (`V38__plant_bio_sections.sql` + `V39__bio_section_prompts_v1.sql`): cached in `plant_bio_sections` keyed by `(plant_id, section_key)`. Only the first two are vision; the rest are text-only to keep cost down. The read path serves from cache and lazy-enqueues `PLANT_BIO_SECTION_REFRESH` jobs; `SPECIES_ID` results cascade-invalidate every species-dependent section when the resolved species changes. Invalidation sites live in `BioSectionInvalidator` (growing/placement/journal/reanalysis).
  - `plant_species_id_v1` (vision) — identity / taxonomy
  - `plant_health_assessment_v1` (vision) — current condition from the photo
  - `plant_species_description_v1` — encyclopedia-style `overview`
  - `plant_water_care_v1`, `plant_fertilizer_care_v1`, `plant_pruning_care_v1`, `plant_light_care_v1`, `plant_placement_care_v1` — structured care guidance per topic
  - `plant_history_summary_bio_v1` — compact history prose for the About pane
- `plant_info_panel_v1` — species facts, history, uses
- `plant_reminder_recompute_v1` — care scheduling
- `pruning_analysis_v1` — conservative pruning guidance from photos
- `plant_history_summary_v2` — compact history timeline for the About pane (optional `owner_physical_address` in the user prompt when the account has a saved address)

---

## Database Schema

Versioned SQL migrations live in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/` (`V__*.sql`). Flyway applies them on startup. See that directory for the current set (plants, images, analyses—including paired care guidance columns on `plant_analyses`, **`taxonomic_family`** on plants and analyses, events, reminders, LLM audit, history, species overview, history summary, **`user_physical_addresses`**, **`plant_bio_sections`** per-section prompt cache, etc.).
